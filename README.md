# What are my Learning Projects:

In this repository there are several projects that I developed to practice programming, organized by language. The main purpose is to have a more clean and presentable GitHub profile deleting some old repositories but keeping my first steps learning new languages or experimenting with code in general registered in this one.


## Python

### Process Matrix

This program consists in creating the process_matrix function, which receives an array of numbers and processes each of them as follows:

<li>The new value of each of them is the average of the old value and the values of its neighbours.</li>
<li>The function will return a new matrix with the changed values following the described algorithm.</li>

## JavaScript

### Classroom Management

The goal was to develop a program that works in the console and allows you to choose different options to modify or display data from a list of students. To execute it run main.js
