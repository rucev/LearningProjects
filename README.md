# What are my Learning Projects:

In this repository there are several projects that I developed to practice programming. The main purpose is to have a more clean and presentable GitHub profile deleting some old repositories but keeping my first steps learning new languages or experimenting with code in general registered in this one.


## Python

### Papers Analisis

A project that given two articles (with APA citation and in English) returs the following extra data: (1) The authors citated in a text (and the amount of times cited). (2) The most frequent words (excluding the so-called stop words) presented in a graphic to show individual frequencies.

### Python Snake

A basic snake game made with Python and Pygame following <a href="https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/">this tutorial.</a>

### Process Matrix

This program consists in creating the process_matrix function, which receives an array of numbers and processes each of them as follows:

<li>The new value of each of them is the average of the old value and the values of its neighbours.</li>
<li>The function will return a new matrix with the changed values following the described algorithm.</li>

## JavaScript

### Classroom Management

The goal was to develop a program that works in the console and allows you to choose different options to modify or display data from a list of students. To execute it run main.js.

### Promises Menu (and a bit more)

Several ways I tried to make an options menu in the JS console respond to user input. Sometimes using promises, sometimes not. 

### Expenses Control:

Create a basic application that shows the expenses, income and total of various transactions. These transactions can be added, deleted and the data saved in the browser local storage.

### Calculator:

A single program that collects numbers using the prompt() method; the user will be able to visualize by console the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division between all numbers with 3 decimal places at most. If the user enters a single number, its square root is displayed.

### Airlines:

Program that allows to check different information in an object array working with prompts an alerts.

## HTML / CSS

### First-Steps Exercises

Multiple pretty basic exercises to start familiarising with both HTML & CSS.

## TypeScript

### TS-Demo

TypeScript demo exercise following the OpenBootcamp's TypeScript Course.
